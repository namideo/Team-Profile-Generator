# Team-Profile-Generator

## Assignment
The purpose of this assignment is to create a backend Node.js command-line application that receives information and displays it on an html page. The application requires the user to input data for a software engineering team. The command-line asks for Manager input than allows the user to build their team. 

There is also test code written for each section within the application.

## Criteria

* When typing in "node index" you are prompted with a command-line that asks for Manager data (name, Id, email, and office number). 

* After entering the Manager data you are prompted to build your team with a selection of either Engineer or Intern. 

* If you select Engineer you are prompted to enter a name, Id, email, and github.

* If Intern is selected then you are prompted to enter a name, Id, email, and school.

* The command-line allows you to repeat this process as often as you like and then finish when your team is completed. 

* The information is then stored and created in an output.html file, where you can view your team profile on a webpage.
